# SPC
Activities for Computational Problems Solutions. Implemented in C++/Python and/or Ruby.
This is a set of problems that will be copleted during the term.
At least 5 problems/week should be accomplished, and all of them must run under certain time and memory limits.
Most of the times, the link to the original problem in some online judge system will be provided. 
If not (i.e. The problem was written in Portuguese), I will try to describe the problems in the file comments.
